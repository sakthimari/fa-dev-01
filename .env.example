# AWS SES Configuration for Email Invitations
# Copy this to .env.local and update with your actual values

# SES Configuration
VITE_AWS_SES_REGION=us-east-1
# FROM_EMAIL is now hardcoded to sakthimari@gmail.com in EmailInvitationService.ts
# VITE_SES_FROM_EMAIL=sakthimari@gmail.com

# IMPORTANT: To send emails from sakthimari@gmail.com, you need:
# 1. Verify sakthimari@gmail.com in AWS SES Console
# 2. Grant your AWS user permission to send emails from this address

# Instructions:
# 1. Go to AWS SES Console â†’ Verified identities
# 2. Add and verify 'sakthimari@gmail.com'
# 3. Ensure your AWS user has 'ses:SendEmail' permission
# 4. For development, you can use the mailto fallback option

# Current Issue: 
# Error: User 't8505@gmail.com' is not authorized to perform 'ses:SendEmail' 
# on resource 'arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456:identity/sakthimari@gmail.com'

# This means:
# - Your code is correctly trying to send from sakthimari@gmail.com
# - But the authenticated user (t8505@gmail.com) doesn't have permission
# - You need to verify sakthimari@gmail.com in AWS SES Console
